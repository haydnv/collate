//! Defines a [`Collate`] trait to standardize collation methods across data types. The provided
//! [`Collator`] struct can be used to collate a collection of items of type `T` where `T: Ord`.
//!
//! [`Collate`] is useful for implementing a B-Tree, or to handle cases where a collator type is
//! more efficient than calling `Ord::cmp` repeatedly, for example when collating localized strings
//! using `rust_icu_ucol`. It's also useful to handle types like complex numbers which do not
//! necessarily have a natural ordering.
//!
//! Use the "stream" feature flag to enable `diff` and `try_diff` functions to compute the
//! difference between two collated `Stream`s, and the `merge` and `try_merge` functions
//! to merge two collated `Stream`s.
